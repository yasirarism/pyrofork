        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            gift_id (``int``):
                Unique identifier of star gift.

            text (``str``, *optional*):
                Text of the message to be sent.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
                List of special entities that appear in message text, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            hide_my_name (``bool``, *optional*):
                If True, your name will be hidden from visitors to the gift recipient's profile.
            
            pay_for_upgrade (``bool``, *optional*):
                If True, gift upgrade will be paid from the botâ€™s balance, thereby making the upgrade free for the receiver.
                For bots only.
                Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: On success, True is returned.
